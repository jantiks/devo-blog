## A brief introduction of me and what can you gain from this blog

Although probably nobody would read this except some close people who already know me well. But let's goo.

I do theoretical computer science and my university is very much focused on research on combinatorics and graph theory. So I also to do my bachelor thesis on a topic related to graph theory. It's about [Hadwiger's conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadwiger%27s_conjecture) a generalization of [4 color theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem) which was proved in 1976 using computers. We are trying to improve the results of a relaxed version of this problem. So here I will post about my studies, how I manage to learn heavy theoretical subjects on my own, and understand not popular papers which don't have any extra explanations, which have common property (Obviously something completly not obvoius is true).

Besides this I will post about my studies and interesting algorithms which I encounter during it (there are so many I want to post about them already).

And lastly I will post about the side projects I am doing, which are usually focused on some non-trivial ways of earning money on stock market, of course as any 22-years old homo sapiens, I wanna make money and be rich. (it's a joke 🙂)

Hopefully my insights would be helpfull to you my reader, and it would influence you to achieve greater things.
